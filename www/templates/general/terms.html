        <p>
          <b>Gail & Judy is a venue</b>
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Gail & Judy acts as a venue to allow Users who comply with Gail & Judy's policies to offer, sell, buy, exchange certain goods and communicate privately and publicly. Gail & Judy is not directly involved in the transaction between Sellers and Purchaser. As a result, Gail & Judy has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the Items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Sellers to sell Items or the ability of Purchasers to pay for items. Gail & Judy does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. Gail & Judy only curates the list of brands from the Items listed. Gail & Judy cannot ensure that a Purchaser or Seller will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, Gail & Judy does not transfer legal ownership of items from the Seller to the Purchaser. Gail & Judy cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a User. Gail & Judy encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Application.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          You agree that Gail & Judy is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other Users, or outside parties on Gail & Judy. You use the Gail & Judy service at your own risk.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          <b>Placement of Items and Catalogues</b>
        </p><br />
        <p>
          The Seller, when uploading an Item into the appropriate Catalogue, must complete the Item placement questionnaire and: describe the Item as exhaustively as possible; indicate defects of the Item, if any; indicate whether or not a warranty is provided for the Item; indicate warranty terms, if any; and indicate the Item price. If the Seller does not indicate Item payment and Delivery conditions, this means the Purchaser is entitled to make an offer to the Seller on the Item payment and Delivery conditions. Only clothes, footwear and accessories may be uploaded to the Catalogue; other goods are not allowed to be subject of a Transaction.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Items uploaded to the Catalogues must be both described in the Item placement questionnaire and photographed. When uploading an Item to a Catalogue, at least one good quality photo of the Item must be placed next to the Item description. It is prohibited to upload photos found on the Internet and uploaded photos must reflect the real quality and external appearance of the Item and show the presence of defects on the Item. Assessment of photo quality is by nature subjective and is at Gail & Judy’s entire discretion. There is no limit on the quantity of Items that may be uploaded to the Application Catalogues; however, it is prohibited to upload the same Item more than once.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Once the Purchaser and the Seller agree on the Item sold and the price, the Purchaser is required to pay for the ordered Item pursuant to the payment terms set forth below under “Payment and Shipping,” and to accept the Item if it complies with the description provided by the Seller. The Seller, by uploading the Item, is deemed to represent and confirm that the Item complies with the description Seller provides and that such description is complete. The placement of Items in the Application Catalogues is free. The Seller, after uploading the Item, shall be entitled to remove it at any time unless he/she is a professional seller. An offer to sell may be retracted at any time prior to its acceptance, but not after.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Items on the Application are purchased and sold by making the Transaction directly between the Purchaser and the Seller and only they are responsible for such Transaction. Except for Gail & Judy’s administrative role regarding payment and shipping, as described below, Gail & Judy is not a party to, does not participate in, and bears no responsibility or liability for, the making or performance of, or otherwise in connection with, such Transaction.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Users are also entitled to exchange/swap Items. In this case, Users make the exchange Transaction directly where Gail & Judy is not a party to, does not participate in, and bears no responsibility or liability for, the making or performance of, or otherwise in connection with, such exchange Transaction. Users have no obligation to accept or decline a swap on the Application.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Gail & Judy provides Payment and Shipping services to facilitate Transactions, including swaps. Sellers offering items for financial consideration may not refuse to Transact with Purchasers to avoid using the Payment and Shipping services made available by Gail & Judy. Sellers are prohibited from voiding a Transaction with the aim of performing the same Transaction without using the Payment and Shipping services, be it with the same Purchaser or with another Purchaser. A Purchaser and a Seller may, prior to Transacting, mutually agree to opt out of the Payment and Shipping services offered by Gail & Judy and mutually agree payment and shipping methods at their discretion and also at their own risk.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          While Gail & Judy is not party to the Transactions, we aim to facilitate a unique and friendly experience for all Users. Only in case of a Sale or a Swap between two Items (and not a swap between multiple Items): If a Purchaser receives the wrong item, one that is faulty, fake or significantly not as described by the Seller, said Purchaser should notify our Community Support team using our Help Center within 3 days of Item delivery. We will hold payments if they have been made via our Payment Services while we encourage Seller and Purchaser to find an amicable solution. We cannot guarantee that such a solution may be found. If a refund is made, it will be for the Item value only, unless the shipping fees have not yet been incurred.
        </p><br /><br /><br />
